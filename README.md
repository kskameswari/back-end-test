# Virgin Atlantic ~ Flight Information Display

Here is an example of a flight times application for Virgin Atlantic. This project represents what we're looking for in 
a candidate and our current technology choices.

Please spend up to 2 hours improving this application. What you improve is up to you: Perhaps it needs more tests,
additional functionality, or some bug fixing.

## Rules

1) The code must be your own work. If you have a strong case to use a small code snippet of someone else's work, e.g. a
boilerplate function, it must be clearly commented and attributed to the original author.
2) The flight data cannot be changed, and must be loaded from the CSV file, so it can easily be replaced with another file.
3) You must include any unit tests you think are appropriate.
4) You are not allowed to add any additional dependencies to the project - make use of what's been provided.
5) Identify intentional gaps in the code by looking for `//FIXME - applicant to complete` and provide either solutions or improvements.

## What it should do
The application should allow the user to select or input any date, of any year, resulting in the display of flights on
that day, displayed in chronological order -- a Flight Information Display.

## Supplying your code
Please **create and commit your code into a public Github repository** and supply the link to the recruiter for review.  Your code should compile and run in one step.

## Supporting Data
The [flight data](./src/main/resources/flights.csv) is a simple comma-separated file containing the following:
